# Copy-and-pasting
To copy and paste on an Apple laptop (Mac), you use the Command key. To copy, select the text you want to copy and press Command + C. Then, go to where you want to paste and press Command + V. You can also use the Control-click method or the menu bar to copy and paste. 

To copy and paste on a Chromebook, use the same keyboard shortcuts as on Windows or macOS. Highlight the text you want to copy, press Ctrl + C (or Cmd + C), then go to where you want to paste and press Ctrl + V (or Cmd + V). You can also use right-clicking and selecting "Copy" and "Paste". Touchscreen Chromebooks can also use two-finger taps to copy and paste.
